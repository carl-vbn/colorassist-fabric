If you need to find blocks of a specific color, you can use the color picker to find them. The color picker is a GUI that allows you to select a color by clicking on it. The mod will then search for blocks of that color and display them. You can then click on a block to add it to your inventory.
To open the color picker, press the `V` key. This can be changed in the game's controls menu.
